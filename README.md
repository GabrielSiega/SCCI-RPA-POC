 Introduction:
 
This project is about using RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to help a Trade Association work faster and better when adding new members. Right now, staff do many tasks by hand, like making invoices, sending welcome emails, and adding emails to a mailing list. These tasks take a lot of time and can have mistakes.
By using RPA, we can make software robots do these jobs automatically. This will save time, reduce mistakes, and help new members feel welcome more quickly.
